<h1> This is a new project </h1>
<h2> New Line!!!</h2>
<p> I am learning how to use git and push to github. </p>
<p> I did this by doing the following </p>
<ul>
<li> In your GitHub profile make a new repository.</li>
<li> In the command line on your computer cd into your working folder and type : [git init] This will initialize a git repository in your project</li>
<li>Next type: [git status] This will list out all the files in your working directory</li>
<li> Then type: [git add .] or [git add name-of-file] This adds in all of your files and changes so far into what is called a staging area. You must add these files into a staging area before you can commit them.</li>
<li> Then type: [git commit -m 'first commit'], this commits all of your files or the one you specifically named with a message, 'first commit'</li>
<li> Next type: [git remote add origin -your github repo URL-]. Your GitHub Repository page will list the repository URL, you can copy/paste it from there into the terminal. This creates a remote, or connection, named 'origin' pointing at the GitHub repository you just made.</li>
<li> Then type: [git push -u origin master]. This sends your commits in your 'master' branch to GitHub.</li>
</ul>

<p>Now you have pushed to GitHub!</p>
<p> To continue making changes and pushing them to GitHub use the following three commands in the terminal</p>
<ul>
<li>[git add .] or [git add name-of file]</li>
<li>[git commit -m 'your message']</li>
<li>[git commit origin master]</li>
